## 📂 Project Structure  

This app is structured using the **MVVM architecture** to ensure clean code practices:  

1. **Model**:  
   - Represents the data layer with Room database entities and DAOs.  

2. **ViewModel**:  
   - Acts as the middle layer handling business logic and state management.  

3. **View**:  
   - Composable functions reactively display data from the ViewModel.
